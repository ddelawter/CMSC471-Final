        <p class="description-box">The heatmap visualization above focuses primarily on exploring the trends of bird flu
            in waterfowl
            across the United States at both the state and county levels from 2021 to 2025. The heatmap shows the number
            of detections
            of bird flu found in each state and or county. When first loaded, the headmap shows only the bird flu
            detections at a
            state level. When the user clicks on a state, the visualization changes to show a heat map of the state at
            the county
            level. The range of the legend changes depending on what state is selected. If the user wishes to go back to
            the original
            map, they simply need to click the button “Reset to national view”, which is only present when in county
            view.

            This interactive line graph visualizes the spread of bird flu among various bird species from 2022 to 2025.
            By default, the graph displays data for all recorded species, with each bird represented by a different
            colored
            line to help differentiate them. Users can use the dropdown menu at the top to filter the graph by a
            specific
            bird species, which dynamically adjusts the graph’s scale to highlight the selected bird’s trend over time
            in a
            better manner. This allows for clearer insight into how bird flu cases have changed for individual species
            across
            the years. Additionally, the graph includes tooltips so that when you hover over a data point, a small popup
            appears showing the species name, the year, and the number of bird flu cases for that specific data point.
            This
            feature makes it easy to explore and compare detailed case numbers for each bird species interactively.

        <p class="line-graph-description"> The dataset used in this project was obtained from the
            <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/wild-birds"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                USDA: Animal and Planet Health Inspection Service</a>.
            We performed minimal cleaning on the dataset, primarily grouping bird species into more accessible and
            consistent categories to
            improve readability in our visualizations. Aside from this standardization step, the dataset was
            well-structured and served our
            analytical and visualization needs effectively.
