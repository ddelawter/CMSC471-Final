Our project, Birdemic, explores trends of bird flu in waterfowl across the U.S. from 2021 to 2025. This visualization is by Lilli Terry, Gnana Nagaruru, and Danielle Delawter. Our project uses a dataset from the USDA: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. It consists of two visualizations: a heatmap and a line graph. The heatmap has a special feature when a state is clicked on. 

Contributions
Danielle created the heatmap and compiled the two visualizations together. 
Gnana created the line graph and wrote the accompanying paragraph. 
Lilli assisted with the heatmap color scales, compiled/sorted through the dataset, and the Website layout/writing.
